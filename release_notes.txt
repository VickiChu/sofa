Our SOFA starts with 1.0.0 version and follows the rule of Linux Kernel release.
Each version is characterized by three number, separated by periods like 
major.minor.patch_release. If the second number is even, it indicates a stable
version like 1.0, 1.2; otherwise, it indicates an unstable version like 
1.1, 1.3. The last number is used for patch releases.

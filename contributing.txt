# How to provide a patch for a new feature

1. If you plan to add new major feature, please don't start coding right away. 
   Please first discuss with us in the SOFA Google group and share your 
   conceptions, which might save your efforts and time.

2. If in step 1 you get any acknowledgment from project leaders, use the 
   following procedure to submit a patch.

    A. Fork SOFA on Github   ( http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/ )
    B. Create a topic branch ( git checkout -b your_branch )
    C. Push to your branch   ( git push origin your_branch )
    D. Pull a new request on Github ( https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/ )

3. For minor updates, please just pull a new request on Github


Thanks a lot.
